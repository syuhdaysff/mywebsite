<p><center>Introduce to you my high-school babes.These people stick with me since I was in school until now. We've learnt so much about ourselves and discovered that our music taste is very similar.</center>
<p><center>No stopping us since then. We spent our whole time together and the class talked to our friendship. We used to aid each other in studying and even visited the household.</center>
<p><center>We went to the summer camp together over our summer break and formed many memories. In addition, we devised our own handshake, which only we knew. </center>
<p><centerI learnt, because I had my best buddy not less than my own family, that family does not end with blood through this bond.</center>
<p><centerSimply said, I've got one of the precious assets I share with my best friend. Both of us inspire each other to improve.</center> 
<p><center>We are driving each other to perform our best and always in need of it. A good friend really is a precious gem and I'm grateful that jewel of my life has been found.</p></center>

<p><center>Friendship is one of the greatest blessings that not everyone is lucky enough to have. We meet a lot of people in the journey of life but there are only a few who leave a mark on us.</center> 
<p><center>These people I met during my diploma year at Uitm Merbok,Kedah.At this point, we shall learn about friendship and relationships, reach out and discover who we truly are.</center> 
<p><center>Without them, i would say that i couldn't survive my studies.The happy and teary moment still stuck in the heart.Without fear of being judged, one must be able to communicate anything.</center>
<p><center>They should be supportive and mutually encouraging. In times of need, you always have to look for your best friends.</p></center>
